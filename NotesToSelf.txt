Got working in Lambda with MongoAtlas & DocumentDb.  Added id verification.

working on cleaning up tests.

to run tests:
./offwego.sh - to get to the right folder
tsc - to compile
npm run test -- -t "STP (1|2|3|4|5|6)  - or run test2 or test3 have different options to deal with callbacks and shows more messages but left hanging
